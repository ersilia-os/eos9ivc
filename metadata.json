    "Description": "Prediction of the activity of small molecules against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This model has been developed by Ersilia thanks to the data provided by the Seattle Childrens (Dr.  Tanya Parish research group). In vitro activity against M. tuberculosis was measured in a single point inhibition assay (10000 molecules) and selected compounds (259) were assayed in MIC50 and MIC90 assays. Cut-offs have been determined according to the researchers guidance. The models have been trained using LazyQSAR and achieved an AUROC of >0.8 in a 3-fold crossvalidation",
